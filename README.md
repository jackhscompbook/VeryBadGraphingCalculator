# VeryBadGraphingCalculator
This is a CLI graphing calculator I'm building. It needs lots of improvements because it's fairly terrible at the moment.


Improvements to be made:
  <br>- improve equation parsing engine.
  <br>- improve graph display by making it generate the graph based on x_max, x_min, etc. params, not be a preset pile of garbage.
  <br>- literally make it use decimals for the love of god why am i so bad at programming.
  <br>- add a Ui so you don't have to fuck with the code to change things.
